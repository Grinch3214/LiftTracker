## 2026-08-10

### Added

- Workout tab (`/`): add/remove exercises and sets for a selected day, rest timer (90s, auto-starts after logging a set), personal record (PR) badge on sets that match the all-time max weight.
- History tab (`/history`): list of past workouts with stats, tap an entry to jump back to that day.
- Per-exercise history popup: past sessions, best set, total volume.
- Static exercise catalog (6 muscle groups, ~35 exercises) and exercise picker (group → exercise).
- Local persistence via `localStorage` (VueUse `useStorage`) — no backend involved.

### Changed

- Extended `Exercise` type with an optional `equipment` field.
- Split UI into `TheHeader` (calendar-driven date navigation) / `TheFooter` (bottom tab bar) and domain component folders (`components/workout`, `components/history`).
- Disabled SSR (`ssr: false`) — app is fully client/`localStorage`-driven; SSR hydration was resetting saved workouts on every reload.

### Fixed

- Vant UI locale defaulting to Chinese — added an English locale plugin.
- Calendar required a second tap/confirm button to close — now closes immediately on date tap.
- Duplicate "Add exercise" button on the empty state (kept only the floating action button).

### Notes

- Feature set intentionally excludes Templates (prebuilt programs) and a separate Progress tab — out of MVP scope per `docs/02-mvp.md`.
